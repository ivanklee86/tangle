ðŸš§ Under construction! ðŸš§

**tangle** (_noun_): A theoretical name for a group of octopuses since in the wild they are solitary creatures.

Tangle makes using with multiple ArgoCDs in a [hub and spoke](https://codefresh.io/learn/argo-cd/a-comprehensive-overview-of-argo-cd-architectures-2024/#post-24596-_1k4hvnsqwl60) architecture fun (ðŸŽ‰) and easy (ðŸ˜…).  Its features work equally well for your CI/CD tooling (i.e. available as JSON APIs with Swagger documentation for testing) fand for your humans (via an embedded website).
